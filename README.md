# Application Note:
# Object-Oriented Programming in C

This [Application Note](AN_OOP_in_C.pdf) describes simple and efficient
implementation of main Object-Oriented concepts of encapsulation,
single inheritance and polymorphism in portable ISO-compliant C.
This implementation is specifically suitable for real-time embedded systems.


## The Accompanying Code

The AppNote is accompanied with actual code that you can compile and
execute on any desktop computer (running Windows, Linux, or MacOS).

Here is the code structure:
